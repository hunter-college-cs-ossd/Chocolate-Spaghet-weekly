*Some* information about me!

### More Information

Hello,
My name is Andrey Shtukenberg, and currently I am a junior undergraduate student at [CUNY Hunter College](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/main/). I am interesting in all Computer Science, but so far, my teams on hackathons have always put me on front-end, where [I have exercised in user experience and interface design](http://myce.link.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/about/about.html). I have created my very own fullstack applications, which can be viewed on [my github page](https://github.com/Fioringo).

Before anything, if you see a duplicated 'n' it's due to my n key malfunctioninng...

Learning electronics and computer science since early age, I have always been interested in connecting physical interactions to virtual ones, and vice versa. It was exciting to see [Samsung's implementation of touching the phones to share files](https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-use-s-beam-android-168272/) even though it was completely cumbersome and unpractical (yes, I prefer [Apple's AirDrop](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204144)). It was even more exciting to see Apple introduce [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/), where they have achieved something I was thinking about for years: geolocking virtual objects. It may not sound fascinating to you, but it's easy to keep track of virtual objects in real world, especially when you move away and out of visual range. I have a lot of experience creating 3D models using [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview), which would help me if I ever wanted to make my own ARKit application. The SDK is great, and I have a few ideas about what to do with it, the only obstacle being the technology not being mature. It takes at least 3-5 years for a technology to become useful in a practical way, and that hasn't been the case with AR as of yet.

*This is it for now.*
