# About Your Jekyll-based Blog Hosted on GitHub Pages


Jekyll is a simple, open-source, blog-aware, static site generator.
Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your 
Jekyll blog on GitHubâ€™s servers for free. The difficult work has
already been done for you; all you have to do is some simple
user-specific tinkering in the repository that has been created for
you.

# Instructions For Setting Up Your Weekly Blog Repository

Follow the steps below in order to set up your weekly blog.

1. Locate your repository (in the class organization); it should be named YOUR_ID-weekly.

2. Click on the repository icon to open it.

3. Find the Settings button and click on it to edit the settings.

4. Scroll down to **GitHub Pages** section.

5. Switch the **None** to the option named **master branch**. 
   If you do not have permission to do this, contact the owner of our
   organization (Stewart Weiss).
    
6. Edit the `_config.yml` file and follow the instructions in the comments in that file.

7. Edit the `about.md` file to include some information about yourself 
(make sure that you are using markdown to format this page.)

8. After you have completed all of the steps above, modify this `README.md` file
so that it contains a short description of your repository. 
You will not need to keep these instructions in this file, since they 
are in the template and can always be read there. As an idea, it could be something
like this:

> This repository belongs to ... and contains weekly blogs written ...
