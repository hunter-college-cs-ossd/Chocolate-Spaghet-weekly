### Making a change - installing developer environment

This is the weekly blog-post for week 10 of 14.

#### Hello there,

This week we had to install the project development environment in order to be able to work on the project we want to contribute to. In my case, it's the [`ckb-next`](https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next), which is a non-Corsair made driver for Corsair keyboards with rgb lighting and macros (shortcuts on keys that can execute altered action(s)). Finding the development environment took some detective work, since nobody on the github page specified what they use for development of this driver. From looking at the files that they had, I figured that they are probably using [Qt](https://www.qt.io), which is popular for graphical interfaces for C++ applications. Since I already had Qt installed, I tried opening the cloned project file, and it didn't work. I tried a few different things, such as importing all of the files into the IDE, but it didn't really want to work with it. Linux is next to try, but I'm afraid development for this project will have to be done without an IDE. The driver compiled correctly, and I can say that it works, which means that we can progress with this project. 

This concludes this week of open source contributions,
*Cheers!*
