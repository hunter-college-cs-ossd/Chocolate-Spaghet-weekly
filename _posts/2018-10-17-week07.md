### Exchanging pull requests part 2!

This is the weekly blog-post for week 7 of 14.

#### Hello there,

This week was similar to last week in that we had to fork more repositories and make more pull requests... However, that was the end of similarities between the two weeks.

This week, we had to create working code that we would contribute to each others' files, and we didn't have an organized way of contributing to each other, so merge conflicts were definitely present this time around.

Something about the merge conflicts: they are simple file markups. For some reason, I expected to see the two different versions side by side, each line being a choice between the original master and the merge request master, but that wasn't the case. The conflicts were simply marked with "`<<<<<<<<<<master`", "`==========`", and "`>>>>>>>>>>master`" (at least to *my* recollection). In order to resolve the conflict one had to simply press a button in the top right corner. But the process is simple enough not to complain about it. I started with [my repository]() first, and then worked my way through my teammates' repositories:
- [`johncgenere's repository`](https://github.com/hunter-college-cs-ossd/johncgenere-weekly)
- [`gutierrezjdr's repository`](https://github.com/hunter-college-cs-ossd/gutierrezjdr-weekly)
- [`f0cus10's repository`](https://github.com/hunter-college-cs-ossd/f0cus10-weekly)

This concludes this week of open source contributions,
*Cheers!*
