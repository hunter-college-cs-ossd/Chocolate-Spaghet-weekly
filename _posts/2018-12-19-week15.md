### Final Post

This is the weekly blog-post for week 15 of 14.

#### Hello there,

My team and I worked on [CKB-next](https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next) as our open source contributions project. It was interesting to look through the project and modify its files to see the outcome. My team was extremely motivated to work on the project and I wish I had the time to be more involved than I was. Thankfully, I will have the opportunity to work on it in my free time and next semester.

##### Contributions

Well, the open source project we wanted to make the dark mode for the program. Turns out, there was already a dark mode, which switched automatically. So, we turned to bug fixing. While the bug that our team has worked on doesn't seem that terrible and is only aesthetic, it wasn't that easy to implement the solution. First there were problems with the program adding more icons to the tray, then there were issues with the Qt. All in all, I think this was a great learning experience in contributions and Qt.

Here is the [issue](https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next/issues/58) that we worked on, as well as the [changes](https://github.com/DanieSegarra36/ckb-next/commit/a2b568dabe1a56e244c00c61b598b7b19c6fecf9) commited. [Daniel](https://github.com/hunter-college-cs-ossd/DanieSegarra36-weekly/) was the one to make a lot of contributions to the project, the pull request as well as contact [tatokis](https://github.com/tatokis).

This concludes the conclusion for this semester of open source contributions.

#### Wrapping up

I just would like to say thank you, to the professor and my fellow classmates for an amazing semester of open source. I've always enjoyed (majority) the computer science community due to the friendliness and openness. I'm glad for this opportunity and am looking forward to the next semester.
*Cheers!*
