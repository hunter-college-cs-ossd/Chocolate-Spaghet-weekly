### Tracking of the bugs - the hunt

This is the weekly blog-post for week 8 of 14.

#### Hello there,

This week we had to use one of the bug trackers to track the bugs of a real life project! In  order  to complete this assignment, we had to complete a multitude of tasks. We did this assignment in a separate repository.

This concludes this week of open source contributions,
*Cheers!*

> Thank you for reading!
