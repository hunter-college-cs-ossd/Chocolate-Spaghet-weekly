### Future post here 

This is the weekly blog-post for week 13 of 14.

#### Hello there,

Work on the open source project has started, and while being a little slow, we are moving forward. My team and I are communicating using slack, which proved to be useful since we can separate different bugs into different channels where we can discuss without mixing things up. We started working on other bugs, but our abilites are still a bit limited by our knowledge of how the program is built. I'm looking into documenting at least the main files. This  part seems to be fairly doable before the semester ends.

This concludes this week of open source contributions,
*Cheers!*
