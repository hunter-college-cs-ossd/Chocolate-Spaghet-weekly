### Evaluating the projects

This is the weekly blog-post for week 9 of 14.

#### Hello there,

*This is my second time typing this up, hopefully it will work this time...*

### QGIS

[QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/), or Quantum Georgraphical Information System, is an open source project and uses [GNU GPL 2.0 license](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/COPYING). From the time this was written, the last commit was made 16 hours ago, but current last commits can be seen in the [commits](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commits/master) tab on [QGIS official GitHub repository](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS). The project currently has [292 contributors](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/graphs/contributors) and people commit to this project daily (as can be seen [here](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/graphs/commit-activity)). Currently there are 2209 open bug reports and 1640 feature requests, totalling at 3849 open issues. As is evident from the [bug-tracking website](https://issues.qgis.org/projects/qgis/issues?per_page=200), the issues are very recent, and the maintainers respond quickly to the issues when they are opened, however as it appears, not on Friday nights. The issues get fair treatment and discussion where necessary. The issues are definitely getting closed, as seen on the same bug-tracking website. There are [35 open pull requests](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls) and maintainers respond quickly enough, as currently there are no open pulls without a response. The last merged pull requests was 16 hours ago, but current last can be seen [here](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged). There is discussion on said pull requests ([example](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7788)) and the community seems to be welcoming. Pull requests get reviewed and maintainers thank the people for their contributions. In conclusion, I think this is a very active, currently on-going project good for people contributing to and spending time on.

### Epiphany

[Epiphany](https://www.openhub.net/p/epiphany) is a web browser for GNOME desktop. First sentences of their website say that it is a "free" application, in a sence of no monetary exchange needed for acquisition of this application, but it is under [GNU GPL 2.0 license](https://www.openhub.net/licenses/gpl), which means it is open source. This project is active and people do submit and close issues in a timely manner, although, compared to QGIS, I feel like this project is not as active. It is extremely easy to find who is contributing to the project throught the [project's gitlab page](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/issues). Currently the project has [100 contributors](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/graphs/master). A side note - finding out the number of contributors is not as easy in gitlabs, since it shows what people has done instead of simple statistics, which is great for the people, but bad for quickly analyzing the project. People commit fairly often, with time between commits ranging between hours and a few days. Currently there are [419 open issues](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/issues), to which the maintainers respond quickly and diligently. The issues are recent, and they are getting closed. There are [2 pull requests](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/merge_requests), and maintainers respond quickly to the requests. The most recent merge approved was [4 days ago from today](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=✓&state=merged). The requests get reviewed and maintainers thank people for their contributions. The community is friendly and maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues. Finishing this evaluation, I have seen a few feature requests and bugs that would be a prime target for new open source developers contributions, as well as a friendly community to welcome these new developers into the open source contributions world. This is a good project to contribute to.

### The LibreOffice

[The LibreOffice](https://www.openhub.net/p/libreoffice) is an open source project, under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.openhub.net/licenses/mozilla_public_2_0). It was difficult to find commits for this project since LibreOffice doesn't use github or gitlabs, but [Gerrit](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/q/status:open). The latest commit is said to be 3 hours ago. The project has about [400 contributors](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/02/libreoffice-stats-400-total-contributors-thousands-of-code-commits-every-month/), with contributors making daily commits. There is approximately [13196 open issues](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/report.cgi?x_axis_field=bug_status&y_axis_field=product&z_axis_field=&no_redirect=1&query_format=report-table&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&product=LibreOffice&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=VERIFIED&resolution=---&longdesc_type=allwordssubstr&longdesc=&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc=&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=&keywords_type=allwords&keywords=&bug_id=&bug_id_type=anyexact&emailassigned_to1=1&emailtype1=substring&email1=&emailassigned_to2=1&emailreporter2=1&emailcc2=1&emailtype2=substring&email2=&emaillongdesc3=1&emailtype3=substring&email3=&chfieldvalue=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&j_top=AND&f1=noop&o1=noop&v1=&format=table&action=wrap), where the issues are recent and are getting closed. There's discussion on said issues and maintainers respond quickly to the issues when they are opened. From [this list](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/q/status:open), I calculate there are 189 open issues, with part of them being stale. A lot of the requests are recent, with maintainers responding to the requests in a timely fashion. The pull requests get reviewed. Most recent merged pull request was today, meaning the project is extremely active. From the small sample size, the community seems to be welcoming, constructive, and timely. Concluding this review, I would say that this project is good to contribute to for beginner open source contributors.

This concludes this week of open source project evaluations,
*Cheers!*
