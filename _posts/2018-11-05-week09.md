### Evaluating the projects

This is the weekly blog-post for week 9 of 14.

#### Hello there,

*This is my second time typing this up, hopefully it will work this time...*

### QGIS

[Quantum GIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) project is open source and uses [GNU GPL 2.0 license](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/COPYING). From the time this was written, the last commit was made 16 hours ago, but current last commits can be seen in the [commits](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commits/master) tab on [QGIS official GitHub repository](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS). The project currently has [292 contributors](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/graphs/contributors) and people commit to this project daily (as can be seen [here](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/graphs/commit-activity)). Currently there are 2209 open bug reports and 1640 feature requests, totalling at 3849 open issues. As is evident from the [bug-tracking website](https://issues.qgis.org/projects/qgis/issues?per_page=200), the issues are very recent, and the maintainers respond quickly to the issues when they are opened, however as it appears, not on Friday nights. The issues get fair treatment and discussion where necessary. The issues are definitely getting closed, as seen on the same bug-tracking website. There are [35 open pull requests](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls) and maintainers respond quickly enough, as currently there are no open pulls without a response. The last merged pull requests was 16 hours ago, but current last can be seen [here](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged). There is discussion on said pull requests ([example](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7788)) and the community seems to be welcoming. Pull requests get reviewed and maintainers thank the people for their contributions. In conclusion, I think this is a very active, currently on-going project good for people contributing to and spending time on.

### Epiphany

[Epiphany](https://www.openhub.net/p/epiphany) is a web browser for GNOME desktop. First sentences of their website say that it is a "free" application, in a sence of no monetary exchange needed for acquisition of this application, but it is under [GNU GPL 2.0 license](https://www.openhub.net/licenses/gpl), which means it is open source. *stuff*

### The LibreOffice

[The LibreOffice] is an open source project, under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.openhub.net/licenses/mozilla_public_2_0). *more stuff*

This concludes this week of open source contributions,
*Cheers!*
