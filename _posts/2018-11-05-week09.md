### The mid-things period

This is the weekly blog-post for week 9 of 14.

#### Hello there,

This week we had to do a few things, so this blog is somewhat in between assignments and whatnot, which is the reason why it has been this hard to keep up with it. When you don't really have much to say, there's not much to say, I mean, `2+2=4`.

> More is coming soon.

Has probably appeared on quite a number of my blogs at this point, and I want to address that. More will come, how soon I'm not sure. But definitely by the end of this weekend.

This concludes this week of open source contributions,
*Cheers!*

> Thank you for reading!
